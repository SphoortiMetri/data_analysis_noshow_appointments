# noshow_appointments
The dataset here contains information about appointments in brazil and is focused on whether or not patients show up to their appointment(s). My aim here is to explore this data and analyze the factors that contribute to patient showing up(or not showing up) for scheduled appointments.


What do I need to install?

* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

While working on this project, I was able to 

1. Learn about all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
2. Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
3. Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
4. Have experience communicating the results of your analysis
5. Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
6. Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
7. Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings


The code has been divided into 4 categories: 

1. Introduction
2. Data Wrangling
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Conclusions
