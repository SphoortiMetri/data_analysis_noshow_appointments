# data_analysis_noshow_appointments
This project focuses on data wrangling on the 'Medical Appointment No Shows' dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments). 
The dataset here contains information about appointments in brazil and is focused on whether or not patients show up to their appointment(s). My aim here is to explore this data and analyze the factors that contribute to patient showing up(or not showing up) for scheduled appointments.

1. Apply all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
2. Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
3. Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
4. Communicate the results of analysis
5. Use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code

#### The code has been divided into 4 categories: 

1. Introduction
2. Data Wrangling
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Conclusions and Limitations
